	Abstract = {This paper examines the consequences and detection of model misspecification when using maximum likelihood techniques for estimation and inference. The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (OMLE) converges to a well defined limit, and may or may not be consistent for particular parameters of interest. Standard tests (Wald, Lagrange Multiplier, or Likelihood Ratio) are invalid in the presence of misspecification, but more general statistics are given which allow inferences to be drawn robustly. The properties of the QMLE and the information matrix are exploited to yield several useful tests for model misspecification.},

@article{10.2307/2289471,
	Abstract = {Large sample properties of the likelihood function when the true parameter value may be on the boundary of the parameter space are described. Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results generalize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this representation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random variable onto the region of admissible values for the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of chi-squared distributions.},

This relation can be derived from the Bryant-Windham construction. Emphasis is placed on binary clustering criteria which are analyzed under the maximum likelihood approach for different multivariate Bernoulli mixtures. This alternative form of criterion reveals non-apparent aspects of clustering techniques. All the criteria discussed can be optimized with the alternating optimization algorithm.

	Abstract = {Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a valuable tool for multigroup classification. LDA is equivalent to maximum likelihood classification assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. In this paper, we fit Gaussian mixtures to each class to facilitate effective classification in non-normal settings, especially when the classes are clustered. Low dimensional views are an important by-product of LDA--our new techniques inherit this feature. We can control the within-class spread of the subclass centres relative to the between-class spread. Our technique for fitting these models permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions of LDA.},

@article{biernacki2020gaussian,
	Abstract = {A generic method is introduced to visualize in a ``Gaussian-like way,''and onto ℝ2{\$}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}R{\}}\^{}{\{}2{\}}{\$}, results of Gaussian or non-Gaussian--based clustering. The key point is to explicitly force a visualization based on a spherical Gaussian mixture to inherit from the within cluster overlap that is present in the initial clustering mixture. The result is a particularly user-friendly drawing of the clusters, providing any practitioner with an overview of the potentially complex clustering result. An entropic measure provides information about the quality of the drawn overlap compared with the true one in the initial space. The proposed method is illustrated on four real data sets of different types (categorical, mixed, functional, and network) and is implemented on the r package ClusVis.},

	Abstract = {We examine whether the quality of different clustering algorithms can be compared by a general, scientifically sound procedure which is independent of particular clustering algorithms. We argue that the major obstacle is the difficulty in evaluating a clustering algorithm without taking into account the context: why does the user cluster his data in the first place, and what does he want to do with the clustering afterwards? We argue that clustering should not be treated as an application-independent mathematical problem, but should always be studied in the context of its end-use. Different techniques to evaluate clustering algorithms have to be developed for different uses of clustering. To simplify this procedure we argue that it will be useful to build a ``taxonomy of clustering problems'' to identify clustering applications which can be treated in a unified way and that such an effort will be more fruitful than attempting the impossible -- developing ``optimal'' domain-independent clustering algorithms or even classifying clustering algorithms in terms of how they work.},

Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear models and model-based clustering. FlexMix provides the E-step and all data handling, while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new models.},
